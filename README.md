### Fourier transformation

1. fork from [https://github.com/YuezhengChuixing/manim-projects]
2. use np.fft instead, and remove camera move
3. only change self.path_n_samples to construct different number of wheels of the Fourier clock
4. with manim-ce

### Hydrogen Density Plots

1. fork from [https://github.com/Solara570/temp]
2. fix some error and use different THETA and PHI naming.
3. the density in Y-Z plane (which should be exactly same as X-Z plane here)
